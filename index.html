<p>
	            • Kalpana Chawla (March 17, 1962 – February 1, 2003) was 
				an Indian-born American astronaut and engineer who was 
				the first woman of Indian origin to go to space in 1997.<br><br>
				• Six years later, on February 1, 2003, Chawla died when 
				the space shuttle Columbia broke up on re-entry into Earth's 
				atmosphere, killing all seven astronauts on board. <br><br>
				• She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a mission
				 specialist and primary robotic arm operator.<br><br>
				 • In 1988, Chawla began working at NASA Ames Research Center, 
				where she did computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research on 
				vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) concepts.
				 Much of Chawla's research is included in technical journals 
				 and conference papers.<br><br> 
				 • She is regarded as a national hero in India. <br><br>
				 • In 1993, she joined Overset Methods, Inc. as Vice President 
				 and Research Scientist specializing in simulation of moving 
				 multiple body problems. Chawla held a Certificated Flight 
				 Instructor rating for airplanes, gliders and Commercial 
				 Pilot licenses for single and multi-engine airplanes, seaplanes 
				 and gliders.<br><br> 
				 • After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1991, 
				 Chawla applied for the NASA Astronaut Corps.
				<br><br> 
				• Kalpana Chawla joined the corps in March 1995 and was selected 
				for her first flight in 1997.
				<br><br> 
				• Her first space mission began on November 19, 1997, as part of 
				the six-astronaut crew that flew the Space Shuttle Columbia flight
				 STS-87. Chawla was the first Indian woman to go in space. She spoke
				the following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space, 
				 <strong>"You are just your intelligence"</strong>. On her first mission, 
				 Chawla traveled over 6.5 million miles in 252 orbits of the earth, 
				 logging more than 376 hours (15 days and 16 hours) in space.
				<br><br> • In 2001, Chawla was selected for her second flight as part
				 of the crew of STS-107. This mission was repeatedly delayed due to 
				 scheduling conflicts and technical problems such as the July 2002 discovery
				  of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners. On January 16, 2003, Chawla 
				  finally returned to space aboard Space Shuttle Columbia on the ill-fated 
				  STS-107 mission.
				<br><br> • The <strong>fourteenth contracted Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft
	           </strong>mission delivering supplies to the ISS was named the <strong>"S.S. Kalpana 
				Chawla"</strong> after her.
				<br><br> • <strong>Asteroid 51826 Kalpana Chawla</strong>, one of seven 
				named after the Columbia's crew
				<br><br> • On February 5, 2003, the <strong>Prime Minister of India</strong> at 
				the time, <strong>Atal Bihari Vajpayee</strong>, announced that a 
				meteorological series of satellites, MetSat, was to be renamed "<strong>
				Kalpana 1</strong>". The first satellite of the series, "MetSat-1", 
				launched by India on September 12, 2002, was renamed "Kalpana-1".
				<br><br> • The Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, named the 
				<strong>Kalpana Chawla Space Technology Cell</strong> in her honor.
				<br><br> • On<strong>1 February 2003</strong> , <b>Kalpana Chawla</b> was
				 one of the seven crew members killed in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.
